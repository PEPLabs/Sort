     * Write a sorting algorithm for an array, and return a sorted array.
     *
     * I recommend trying first to write a sorting algorithm yourself, while making extensive use of the debugger to see
     * how the values are shifting about. You may have to look up how to use your IDE's debugger (VSCode if you are
     * using GitPod.)
     *
     * Think of how a human might try to do this - you may have an inefficient solution. Or, you may also try
     * research the code for a sorting algorithm yourself, and seeing how the logic works through time using
     * the debugger! Selection sort is a good algorithm that you can also look up the code for.
     *
     * The sorting algorithm you're likely to write here is probably O(n^2), because it involves a nested for loop,
     * which results to the amount of work needed to complete a problem scaling quadratically with respect
     * to an increase in the amount of items to be sorted. There are O(n*log(n)) sorting algorithms as well, which
     * scale slightly more efficiently than an O(n^2) solution.
     *
     * @param nums an array of unsorted numbers.
     * @return an array containing the values of nums, but sorted.
